            <h1 class="bigText">Hi, I'm Naeem!</h1>
            <p class="text">
                I'm currently a second year student working towards a degree in Computer Science.
                My journey with the Scandinavian Nordic Student Association (SNSA) has been brief,
                but undoubtedly memorable! 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Getting to know those involved (as members,
                volunteers, executives, and faculty supporters) has demonstrated to me that the
                SNSA is something special. It is a collective of amazing people, who are kind,
                friendly, supportive, and welcoming. There is not a doubt in my mind that the club
                is an integral part of many lives, mine included.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I believe it's imperative to continue to help foster the sense of community that has
                grown amongst us. To continue to spread and celebrate the Scandinavian and Nordic
                cultures and languages with you all. And to continue our journeys together,
                trying new things, hosting shared experiences, and learning evermore.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The SNSA is the best club at UBC; I plan to continue the incredible 
                work set forth by the current executive team which has made it as such.
